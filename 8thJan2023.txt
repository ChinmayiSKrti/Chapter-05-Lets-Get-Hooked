1.React's File structure: 
Ref: https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html

2.Two ways to export:
i)Default Import : export default ComponentName;
->Can be done if there is only one thing to be exported from that file
When using default export, we can have different name for component being extracted
ii)Named Imports : export by name
->Can be used to export multiple things from a file
Note: Named Import might look like object destructuring
But it isnt, for example
import obj from './componenets/Header'
const {Title} = obj;
OR 
obj.Title 
these above lines wont work.
import * as Obj from './componenets/Header';
Obj.Title can be done in that case

import obj from './componenets/Header.js' works fine
import obj from './componenets/Header.jsx' also works fine - 
But sometimes some external libraries track our files with extensions, then it mightttt break,
otherwise both .js or .jsx is fine.
Better to use .js :)

3.Always keep your code cleaner and maintainable
Create new componenets and put it in different file wherever necessary

4.One way data binding
Normal variables are not tracked by react, so any change in any variable wont be reflected on UI 
Inorder for react to track the variables that keeps changing its value,
we use something know as state variables
=>If you want to use local variables in React, use states

5.Hooks
At the end of the day its a normal function
i)useState - is a hook used to create state variables
returns an array, first variable is variable name, second variable is function used to modify the state

6.Synthetic events

7.variables to be in sync with UI - use state variables, 
otherwise using normal local variables, wont be tracked by React, and hence doesnt reflect on UI on change
